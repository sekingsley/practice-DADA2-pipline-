Practice DADA2 pipeline for 16s amplicon sequencing 
#this is a practice set of the DADA2 pipeline created by https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial.html
#the data is from three replicate pumice rock samples collected from a submarine erupted volcano in the South Pacific ocean and one negative contorl
#for a more detailed decription please follow the DADA2 pipeline linked above 
#This code was conducted on a M1 2020 macbook air
# this code continues on after the DADA2 pipeline ends. After you assign taxonomy to the ASV's this code shows how to make ASV tables in order to determine the relative abundance of the different taxa. This code can be altered depending on what taxa is being studied 
# where Phylum is in the code, you can replace with any other taxa.
